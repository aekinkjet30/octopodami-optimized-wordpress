# Octopodami&reg; Optimized WordPress (OOW)

With Octopodami&reg; Optimized WordPress (OOW), you can launch a WordPress stack preconfigured for auto-scaling, maintainability, performance, and security.

Our expert engineers developed this 1-Click Amazon Machine Images (AMI) with rapid deployment in mind; we guarantee you will be up and running in 60 seconds on Amazon Web Services.

Instead of spending countless hours learning the intricacies of configuring a scalable WordPress site, we've packaged our stack with everything you need to hit the ground running on the world's leading cloud platform.

## Features

Octopodami Optimized WordPress (OOW) uses the following technologies:

1. **Nginx**: a fast and light-weight web server
2. **Nginx FastCGI Cache**: provides page-level caching at the web server level
3. **Amazon Linux**: CentOS-based operating system, optimized for AWS
4. **PHP7**: drops many [deprecated functions](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/migration70.deprecated.php) in favor of [new, modernized features](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/migration70.new-features.php). Additionally, [PHP 5.6](https://secure.php.net/supported-versions.php) will stop receiving security updates on December 31, 2018.
5. **MySQL (Percona Server)**: Enhanced drop-in replacement for MySQL based on XtraDB or TokuDB storage engines with improved performance and additional diagnostic and management features.
6. **[WP-CLI](https://wp-cli.org/)**: enables the management of WordPress from the command line.
7. **ModSecurity**: assists with WordPress brute force attempts resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) attack among other security issues.
